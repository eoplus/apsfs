\description{
Backward Monte Carlo Code to calculate the elastic scattering Point Spread 
Function (integrated in bin area) of a vertically stratified but horizontally 
homogeneous atmosphere at monocromatic regime.
}
\details{
This backward Monte Carlo radiative transfer code calculates the area 
integrals of the Point Spread Function of the atmosphere due to elastic 
scattering in a layered atmosphere. Turbulence effects and inelastic 
scattering are not included. Additional simplifications of the current 
surface reflectance (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function effects 
not included). The surface is considered totally absorbing, such that 
multiple interaction between surface and atmosphere are not included.

The atmosphere profile atm should be a named data frame as the one created by 
function \code{get_opt_atm_prfl}. If the profile is create manually or with 
user functions, it must contain at least the same variables and column names.
It may also include pressure in the attributes (attr(atm, "press") <- value),
and in this case the parameter press can be omitted.

The initial direction of the photon package is sampled assuming equal 
sensibility of the sensor to all directions within its FOV. As an example, 
the FOV of the Operational Land Imager (OLI/Landsat 8) is ~ 8.6E-5(radians). 
To simulate a sensor with infinitesimal FOV, set snsfov = 0.
The FOV is centered in sensor zenith angle. The photon package is initiated 
at the upper boundary of the layer where the sensor is located. The sensor 
azimuth is set to 90 degrees, such that it is to the right of the center of 
the PSF grid.

At each iteration, a free optical path is sampled and the photon package is 
moved in metric scale. A check is made to verify if photon reached the 
surface or if it escaped the system. If it reached the surface, its intensity
("photon package weight") is added to the appropriate accumulator bin. The 
accumulator geometry can be: (1) 'annular', which only keep track of the 
annular bin in which the photon reached the surface; (2) 'sectorial', wich 
divide the annuli in sectors for azimuthal assymetry; or (3) 'grid', which 
will keep track of the {x,y} position. The 'annular' accumulator is 
appropriate for symmetrical conditions, as nadir view over a Lambertian 
surface. Note that regardless of extent of the accumulator, a final bin will 
be added between ext and Inf. The resolution of the accumulator will have an
impact on the performance, as too high resolution, specially in 'grid' 
geometry will require more photons to be traced to reduce statistical 
sampling variation. Note that when using 'sectorial' geometry, angular 
resolution in azimuth is fixed to 1 degree and break points returned by the 
function refer only to the radius break points (angular break points will be
0:360 always).

The reduced performance with high resolution grid and the need for high 
resolution close to the target pixel while low resolution is sufficient for 
larger distances suggests two separate runs. Those grids can be combined
later with the function \code{fit_grid_dpsf} to produce a Zernike polynomial
fit to the density PSF. This model can then be used to generate a discrete 
PSF kernel at any sensor resolution.

To reduce the random sampling fluctuation in the sectorial and grid 
geometries, the grid is 'folded' on its axis of symmetry (sensor azimuth 
line), averaged and then 'unfolded'.

Note that the returned values are fractional contribution per accumulation 
bin (integrals), and so are not normalized per area. Conversion to per area
contribution can be made with function \code{an_psf}.

An R version of the code is also provided. It is present mainly for 
validation reasons but can be useful in a system without a compiler to
compile the C code. It will run many times slower though.
