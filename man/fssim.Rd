\description{
Contains the fitted coefficients of the atmospheric point spread functions
(APSFs) simulated for the continental standard aerosol model of the 6SV 
radiative transfer code. Simulations were carried out without Rayleigh 
contribution, and with an aerosol scale height of 2 km. Sensor was positioned
at TOA, with three view angles (0, 30 and 60 degrees) and  had an infinitesimal 
field of view. The fitted model can be expanded into line, sectors or grid 
spatial representation with the functions \code{apsfs::predict_annular}, 
\code{apsfs::predict_sectorial} and \code{apsfs::predict_grid}. The vertical 
optical thickness for all simulations was 0.5, but dependence on optical 
thickness is small. By construction, aerosol APSF have no pressure 
dependence. See \code{?apsfs::fit_sectorial} for further details.
