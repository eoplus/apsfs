\description{
Contains the fitted coefficients of the atmospheric point spread functions
(APSFs) simulated for the different standard aerosol models of the 6SV 
radiative transfer code: maritime (mar), continental (con) and urban (urb). 
Simulations were carried out without Rayleigh contribution, and with an 
aerosol scale height of 2 km. The APSF for Rayleigh alone (ray) is also 
available. Sensor was positioned at TOA, with nadir view angle and 
infinitesimal field of view. The fitted model can be expanded into a grid 
spatial representation with the function \code{apsfs::predict_grid}. The 
vertical optical thickness for all simulations was 0.5, but dependence on 
optical thickness is small. By construction, aerosol APSF have no pressure 
dependence. The fitted Rayleigh simulations include pressure dependence with 
limits of 1100 to 500 mbar. See \code{?apsfs::fit_annular} for further 
details.
