\title{\pkg{apsfs}: Atmospheric Point Spread Function and Spherical Albedo Function Simulation}
\description{
This package contains functions to calculate the atmopsheric point spread 
function (PSF) for a given geometry and atmospheric composition and profile 
and functions to fit this data to annular, sectorial, or grid models. It can 
also calculate the spatially-resolved spherical albedo function (SAF).
}
\details{
The PSF and SAF are calculated with backward Monte Carlo with the following 
simplifications: 
\itemize{
 \item Plane paralel geometry;
 \item Layered medium;
 \item Lambertian surface;
 \item Molecular absorption not included.
}

Simulations can be recorded in a annular for symmetric conditions (Lambertian 
surfaces and sensor looking at nadir), and sectorial geometry or grid 
geometry for asymmetric conditions (surface BRDF and or zenith view angles 
away from nadir).

The results can then be fitted to models to provide flexibility for 
application. Cumulative annular data is fitted to a two term exponential 
function, the sectorial data is fitted to a SVD, while grid data is fitted 
with Zernike polynomials.

Below is the list of exported functions in this package:
\itemize{
 \item get_mol_par: Calculate the molecular absorption and optical depth
 \item get_opt_atm_prfl: Calculate optical properties of atmospheric layers 
       in high resolution
 \item cos2sph: Directional cosines to polar angles
 \item mc_psf: Solves the radiative transfer with the Monte Carlo method to 
       simulate the PSF
 \item mc_saf: Solves the radiative transfer with the Monte Carlo method to 
       simulate the SAF
 \item dpsf: Calculates the PSF density (per area, in m^2)
 \item fit_radial_psf: Fit a cumulative annular model to radial PSF geometry
 \item fit_grid_psf: Fit grid PSF geometry with Zernike polynomials
 \item calc_cdf: Calculate the cumulative density distribution from 
       scattering phase functions
 \item ray_ph: Rayleigh scattering phase function
 \item scat_aer: Get scattering direction after aerosol interaction
 \item scat_ray: Get scattering direction after Rayleigh interaction
 \item rayleigh_od: Calculate the Rayleigh optical depth at a given pressure 
       and altitude
